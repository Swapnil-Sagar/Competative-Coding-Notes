Input and output is sometimes a bottleneck in the program. The following
lines at the beginning of the code make input and output more efficient:

ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
cin.tie(0);

Note that the newline "\n" works faster than endl, because endl always
causes a flush operation.



It is risky to compare floating point numbers with the == operator, because it
is possible that the values should be equal but they are not because of precision
errors. A better way to compare floating point numbers is to assume that two
numbers are equal if the difference between them is less than ε, where ε is a
small number.

In practice, the numbers can be compared as follows (ε = 10−9):

if (abs(a-b) < 1e-9) {
// a and b are equal
}
